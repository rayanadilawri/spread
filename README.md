This project was completed a collaboration between two MPS communications design students, Rayana Dilawri and Amely Richter, for a project at Parsons school of design. We designed this article for mobile and desktop based on chapter 1 from the reading the reading “Design as Art” by Bruno Munari. Our Article was inspired by the Bauhaus movement and it’s goals of making art accessible for all. Link to reading: http://imagineallthepeople.info/Munari-1966-Design-as-art.pdf
